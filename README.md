# Covariate Defect Simulation
This repository contains python functionality to generate simulated covariate data. The main covariate methods are located via `covar_sim` and should be imported when designing new features. This file should not be modified unless changes are confirmed, which should be designed via separate feature files / forks and pushed with permission or added via pull / merge request.

See `covar_sim.py` for current functionality. For now, import `CVModel` from `covar_sim` and go from there.
